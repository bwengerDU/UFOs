# UFOs

## Project Overview

In this project I am assisting a friend, Dana, on a project to filter and view large data about UFO sightings. JavaScript's updated ECMAScript system was used as the foundation for the project. Utilzing arrow functions within the ES6 update were critical to achieve desired outcomes in a more compact and concise manner. I was able to build an html site that included aesthetic features courtesy of CSS syntax that gave the site a nice, polished finish. Within it I developed a table that would allow for the large data base provided to be filtered according to a handful of filters including date, city, state, country and shape. 

## Results

1) The initial landing page showcases a proper page layout with background information contained in the body and a table populated with full data at the bottom. Five filter sections are located on the bottom left to sort through the data within the table.

2) The first search filter I applied was to narrow the searches down to those that happened in the state of California. By typing "CA" into the state search bar and hitting Enter I was able to narrow the list down significantly.

3) I further narrowed down my search by typing "Sphere" in the "Shape" search filter. This filter was combined with the previous search filter because it was not actively cleared from the filter and the result is a list of 2 occurrences of Sphere shaped observations in the state of California.

## Summary

Overall, the page I created serves our needs and successfully allows for the filtering of the large data that was provided. There are a few items that could be addressed to improve the site and create a better user experience. 

- The page has issues with punctuation in which apostrophes are read as a series of code symbols. I would further delve into JavaScript features to find coding that would clean these types of syntax issues. 

- I would prefer to have a button to clear or refresh the search filters. As it stands I would have to delete the text from the search bar and enter to remove the filter. If someone was not paying close attention they may overlook having a filter activated and it could have a significant impact on the data they are viewing in the table. 

- A significant improvement to the website would be to have a live source for data in order for the searches to remain relevant and as helpful as possible. 

- I feel like it would be helpful to search via a date range as opposed to a singular date. It would be helpful for anyone looking to quickly identify any seasonal trends. 

The image below shows the punctuation errors that occurred in the "Comments" section. The image also shows that potential pitfall of clearing one filter and possibly forgetting another filter is still activated. The California filter was removed from the earlier search, but the "Sphere" shape filter was still activated.
